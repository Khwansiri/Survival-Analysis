# Survival Analysis  
## Objective:  
Evaluate clinicopathological and radiologic factors for the prognosis of lung squamous cell carcinoma.  
## Data description:
This dataset contains 398 records from patients who had curative surgery for lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
at Samsung Medical Center, Korea between January 2003 to December 2012.   
The records of the 21 features can be separated into 3 groups: Clinical, Histopathologic and Radiological features.
