*Part 1: Test relationship between radiologic/clinicopathologic features and death*

Methods used:
1. Fisher's exact test (determine the relationship between two categorical variables)
2. Logistic regression (determine the relationship between categorical continuous variables)

## Relationship between radiologic features and death

### Fisher's exact test

Determine the relationship between two categorical variables

Hypotheses:
H0: there is no relationship between the two categorical variables.
H1: the variables are dependent. Knowing the value of one variable helps to predict the value of the other variable.


----
1. Difference in risk of death in patient with and without obstructive pneumonitis/ atelectais
2. Difference in risk of death in patient with and without lung effusion
----


1. Difference in risk of death in patient with and without obstructive pneumonitis/ atelectais:
```{r}
with(lungSCC, fisher.test(table(death, Obst_pn_or_plugging)))
```



2. Difference in risk of death in patient with and without lung effusion:
```{r}
with(lungSCC, fisher.test(table(death, Effusion)))
```


### Logistic regression

Determine the relationship between categorical continuous variables

Hypotheses:
H0: there is no different in odds between that specific group and reference group
H1: Odds of that specific group and reference group is statistically significant

Interpretation:
Estimate of interception = The log odds when covariate(s) equal 0
Estimate of each variable = The increase/decrese in the log odds when compare to reference group
To define the odds ratio, exponent estimate value.

## Relationship between clinicopathologic features and death

### Fisher's exact test

Determine the relationship between two categorical variables

Hypotheses:
H0: there is no relationship between the two categorical variables.
H1: the variables are dependent. Knowing the value of one variable helps to predict the value of the other variable.

Odds ratio:
Odds for death in patient with specific condition
divided by odds for death in patient without specific condition
If those 2 sets of patient have equal odds (odds ratio = 1), that specific condition are independent to death status
