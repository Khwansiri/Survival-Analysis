*# Part2: Test relationship between radiologic/clinicopathologic features and survival time (OS)*

*## Part2.A: Cox Proportional Hazards Regression Model fit*

Methods used: Cox Proportional Hazards Model

The Cox regression results can be interpreted as follow:

*1. Statistical significance:*
The Wald statistic value z, corresponds to the ratio of each regression coefficient to its standard error (z = coef/se(coef)). The wald statistic evaluates, whether the beta (Î²) coefficient of a given variable is statistically significantly different from 0. 

*2. The regression coefficient:*
The second feature to note in the Cox model results is the the sign of the regression coefficients (coef). A positive sign means that the hazard (risk of death) is higher, and thus the prognosis worse, for subjects with higher values of that variable. The R summary for the Cox model gives the hazard ratio (HR) for the second group relative to the first group.

*3. Hazard ratios (HR):*
The exponentiated coefficient (exp(coef)) gives the effect size of covariates.

*4. Confidence intervals of the hazard ratios:*
The summary output also gives upper and lower 95% confidence intervals for the hazard ratio (exp(coef)).

*5. Global statistical significance of the model:*
Finally, the output gives p-values for three alternative tests for overall significance of the model: The likelihood-ratio test, Wald test, and score logrank statistics. These three methods are asymptotically equivalent. For large enough N, they will give similar results. For small N, they may differ somewhat. The Likelihood ratio test has better behavior for small sample sizes, so it is generally preferred.

Thanks to these results, we can decide to reject or keep covariates for the upcoming study based on their statistical significance.


*## Part2.A.1: Cox Proportional Hazards Regression Model fit including all the studied features*

```{r}
lungSCC_fullmodel <- coxph(Surv(OS, death) ~ Location + Obst_pn_or_plugging + Necrosis + Underlying_lung + Effusion + Sex + AG + LN_ratio + cT+ cN + cM + pT+ pN+ pM + Smoking_state + FEV1_FVC + CEA + OP + meta, data=lungSCC)

summary(lungSCC_fullmodel)
```


Let's save the table of results in a csv file:
```{r}
broom::tidy(lungSCC_fullmodel) %>%
   write_csv("coefficients_table.csv")
```

We will now compute the Cox Proportional Hazards Regression Model fit for each individual variable and their corresponding confidence intervals (CI).
This step will help us select the significant covariate for the upcoming study.
